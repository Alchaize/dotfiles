# NP-complete
A language is NP-Complete if it is in [[Class NP]] *and* every language in NP is polynomial time reducible to that language.

## Adding more languages to the set NP-complete
To add another language L to the set of NP-complete languages, do the following:
1. Show that L is in NP
2. Choose an NP-complete language B
3. Construct a transformation *f* that reduces B to L
4. Show that *f* runs in polynomial time.
