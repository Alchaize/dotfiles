# Language theory
Very central to this topic is the [[Chomsky Hierarchy]]. Languages are produced by [[Grammars]].

## Decidability
A language is decidable if there exists some [[Turing Machine(s)]] that accepts it in finite time.

The [[Turing Machine(s)]] decides a language L if and only if it halts in an accepting state if an input w is in the language, and halts in a non-final state if it is not.

## Membership
The membership questions deals with whether a string is within a language or not.

## Recognizable
A language is recognizable if some [[Turing Machine(s)]], the TM halts in a final state if the input is in the language. The TM may run in an infinite loop if the input is not in the language.

## Countability

## Enumerability
