An algorithm for determining membership in [[Context-free Languages]], languages produced by [[Context-free Grammars]]. It requires that the grammar is on [[Chomsky Normal Form]].

## Info
It is an algorithm that uses a string and a grammar. Then answers whether that string could have been generated by that grammar.

## How it works
Assume a context-free grammar G, on CNF, and a string w maybe produced by G.

The algorithm checks if there are any sub-strings of w that can be produced by G. If yes, then if the non-terminals that produced the sub-strings can be produced by G. The algorithm then continues with this until a non-terminal is found that produces the entire string, using these sub-strings. If one of the non-terminals that produces the entire string is the starting non-terminal, then we know that w can be produced by G. This should be clear when looking at the image.

## Complexity
The algorithm runs in $\mathcal O (n^3)$
