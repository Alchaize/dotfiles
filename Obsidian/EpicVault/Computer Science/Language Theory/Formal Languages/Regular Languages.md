# Regular languages
- The smallest set in the [[Chomsky Hierarchy]]
- [[DFA]]
- [[NFA]]
- [[Regular Expressions]]

## Closure
The set of regular languages are closed under the following:
- Union
- Concatenation
- Kleene closure
- Set difference
- Intersection
- Reversal

## Decidable
- Membership
- Emptiness
- Finiteness
- Infiniteness
- Equivalence

## Pumping lemma
[[Pumping Lemma]]

## Computational Power
[[DFA]], [[NFA]] and [[Regular Expressions]] all have the same computational power. This means that all of them accept the same set of strings.
