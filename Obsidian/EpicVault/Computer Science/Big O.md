# Big $\mathcal O$


Let f and g be functions $f, g : N \rightarrow R$ $f(n) = \mathcal O (g(n))$ if for some positive integers c and $n_0$ exist so that every integer $n \geq n_0$ the following is true:
$$f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$$

$f(n) = \mathcal O (g(n))$ means that $g(n)$ is an upper bound for $f(n)$. Also, *f has at most order g*
