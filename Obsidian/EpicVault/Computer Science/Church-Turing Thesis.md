# Church-Turing Thesis
``` 
Any computation that can be carried out by mechanical means can be performed by some Turing machine.
```
*Can't be proven*, because of "mechanical means". Better viewed as a definition of "mechanical means":
```
A computation is mechanical if and only if it can be performed by some Turing machine.
```
Because we are using it as a definition, how do we know it is broad enough? Are there mechanical computations that we will be able to do on computers, that aren't possible on [[Turing Machine(s)]]?

Not possible to answer with 100% certainty, but all evidence seem to point to the definition being broad enough.

Accepting the Church-Turing thesis, algorithms can be defined precisely.
See [[Algorithm]].

## Effects
Constructing Turing machines takes a lot of time, but with this thesis, we can assume that any computation possible on today's computers are also possible to do using a Turing machine. This makes it a lot easier to prove that there is an algorithm for a given problem.
