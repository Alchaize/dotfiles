# Storing Vertex Data
When using [[Vertice(s)]], we need a way to efficiently store them. We need fast access and we need to be able to get anywhere in the datatype quickly. Therefore we use continuous arrays.

## Methods of storing the data
[[Triangle List]]
[[Triangle Strips]]
[[Indexed Triangle Mesh]]
