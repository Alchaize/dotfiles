# Object in graphics
An object is built by multiple [[Vertice(s)]].
Between them we draw edges.
For ease of computation, we use triangles as polygons to build a "face"
Using a lot of polygons, we build a mesh

## Object properties
Objects can use materials to define color, opacity and how reflective they are.
