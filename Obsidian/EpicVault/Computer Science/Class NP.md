# Time complexity class NP
For some problems, we haven't been able to find a polynomial time deterministic TM to decide it. But we do have a non-deterministic solution in polynomial time.

## Defining NP
$$\mathcal{NP} = \bigcup_{k \geq 1} NTIME(n^k)$$

The set of languages decidable by a non-deterministic [[Turing Machine(s)]], in polynomial time.
