### Problem:
Meeting a new person and then requiring more and more of their time, until they can't bear it anymore and blocks you.

## Just some general notes
- Notice that it is not always your fault, but it might be. Be honest with yourself.
- If it is your fault, remember that this means you can do something about it.
- Notice that in the beginning, it's okay.
- After some time, notice that you're adding more and more requirements of the other person.
- You might be getting nervous that the other part is breaking contact, and try to contact them more and more to make sure they know you still exist.
- This confuses the other person, they are not ready for this need.
- Might make them pull away, leading to more anxiety and even worse behavior on your part.

## How to break the cycle
- Try to notice when you're starting to get anxious.
- Might be helpful to say what you're feeling. Of course, in a reasonable way.
- Most helpful, noticing what's going on and work on that.
