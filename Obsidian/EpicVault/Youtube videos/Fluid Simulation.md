## Microscopic perspective

- A lot of information can be ignored, because it's too much data otherwise and a lot of it does not matter.
- See fluid as different layers:

### First Layer, Quantum Mechanics
- How do you track super tiny things? Like electrons?
- When measuring things like electrons will disturb it with our current ways of measurements.
- Often use statistics instead, think of it kind of like cloud: the denser it is, the higher the chance of a particle being there.
-  Another problem: electrons and the like acts like waves when we are not observing them.
-  If we don't look at *everything*, results might not make sense because some wave crashed against a wall that was outside our scope.

#### Model order reduction
- When looking at a probability density function of a particle. A repeated pattern can often be seen.
- Using the repeated pattern, we can construct a couple of template standing waves.
- The templates can be used to model the real behavior quite well, but needing way less computation.
 - Unfortunately it does not reduce the amount of computations needed low enough for a fluid simulation (of meaningful volume).
####
We need to go a step broader...

### Second Layer, Molecular Dynamics
- We no longer need those pesky probability functions
- We smudge the particles in layer one into atoms which have concrete positions and interact with one another by forces. More specific, attraction.
