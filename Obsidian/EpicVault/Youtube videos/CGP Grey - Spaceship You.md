## Notes about video
- Isolated life is like a spaceship, you have to maintain it to avoid fatal consequences.
- The physical and mental aspects are connected, usually it's easier do maintain physical.
- Divide your space into smaller subspaces, with the intent to use each subspace for a certain activity.
- Blurring the lines between subspaces leads to non-effective work or sleep or training etc.
- Keep each subspace tidy, it makes it more pleasant to be there.
