## What happened today?
These are the things that happened:
- I slept longer than usual
- I notice I have been a bit stressed out (judging by my dreams).
- I haven't been waking up too nicely.
- I have been working on moving the things I learned from the DV3 course.
- I have listened quite a lot to the artist Hozier.
- I have watched a couple of episodes of Mr. Robot.

### Note something you appreciate about today
Something I appreciate about today is that:
I started with this diary, and I feel hopeful about what it will bring me in the future.
Another thing is that I really enjoyed watching Mr. Robot. I like that show quite a lot.

## Did you learn anything?
I learned that:
- The word "learnt" is only a thing in British English. Americans use "learned"
- The second live action Scooby-Doo movie is apparently very bad.

## How have you felt today?
ðŸ¥±
I have been tired and I've had a bit of a headache. But other than that, I've been good.

## Do you feel like you accomplished something today?
Yes.
